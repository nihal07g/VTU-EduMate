## üîé Key Observations

### **Common Subjects Across All Branches**:

* **3rd Semester**: Social Connect and Responsibility (BSCK307)
* **4th Semester**: Biology For Engineers (BBOK407), Universal Human Values (BUHK408)
* **5th Semester**: Research Methodology & IPR (BRMK557), Environmental Studies (BESK508)
* **6th Semester**: Professional Elective + Open Elective

### **Branch-Specific Patterns**:

* **CSE & ISE** share many CS fundamentals but diverge in 5th‚Äì6th sem specializations
* **ECE** follows electronics/communication-heavy track
* Subject codes follow pattern **B[Branch]xxx** where Branch = CS, IS, EC

### **Coverage Statistics**:

* **Total theory subjects**: 57 across 3 branches (19 per branch)
* **Subject distribution**: Mix of core engineering, branch-specific, and interdisciplinary subjects
* **Elective flexibility**: 6th semester includes both professional and open electives for specialization

### **VTU EduMate Integration**:

* All subjects are mapped in [`data/syllabus/vtu_syllabus.json`](../data/syllabus/vtu_syllabus.json)
* Subject-specific content available in [`data/syllabus_resources/`](../data/syllabus_resources/)
* RAG system can answer questions for any of these 57 subjects
* ML processor provides VTU-specific question complexity analysis

## üìö Implementation in VTU EduMate

### Subject Data Structure
```json
{
  "2022": {
    "CSE": {
      "3": {
        "Discrete Mathematical Structures": {
          "code": "BCS301",
          "credits": 4,
          "modules": [...],
          "keywords": ["discrete math", "graph theory", "combinatorics"]
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### API Integration
```javascript
// Get all subjects for a specific branch and semester
const subjects = getSubjectsByBranchSemester("2022", "CSE", "6");
// Returns: ["Cloud Computing", "Machine Learning", ...]

// ML analysis considers VTU subject codes
const analysis = analyzeQuestionForSubject("BCS602", question);
// Returns VTU-specific complexity and marks recommendation
```

### RAG System Coverage
- **Sample Content**: Professional content for BIS601, BCS602, BME654B, BIS613D
- **Expandable**: Easy addition of new subject materials
- **Citation Mapping**: Links answers back to specific VTU subject codes
- **Context Awareness**: Understands VTU exam patterns and marking schemes
